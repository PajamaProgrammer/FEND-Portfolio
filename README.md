This is the 1st project in Udacity's [Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001) program.

In this project, I am provided with a design mockup for a portfolio website that I must replicate.  
The website I create must be responsive, and must provide an overview of each of the portfolio projects that I complete throughout the nanodegree program.  
It must also adhere to the program's [styleguide](http://udacity.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-styleguide/) and be validated against the [W3C's Validators](http://validator.w3.org/).  
I am free to personalize the design as I wish.
