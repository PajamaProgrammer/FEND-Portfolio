This is the 1st project in Udacity's [Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001) program.

In this project, I am provided with a design mockup for a portfolio website that I must replicate.  
The website I create must be responsive, and must provide an overview of each of the portfolio projects that I complete throughout the nanodegree program. I am free to personalize the design as I wish.

It must also adhere to the program's [styleguide](http://udacity.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-styleguide/) and be validated against the [W3C Markup Validator](http://validator.w3.org/) and [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input).
